# [HIGH] The "callable" type hint is not compatible with PHP 5.3
# [HIGH] DataModel reorder is non-deterministic when multiple records with the same ordering value exist in the same scope
# [HIGH] LayoutHelper: we aren't loading files from the layouts directory
# [HIGH] When a record is locked and cannot be unlocked it should not be saved regardless
# [MEDIUM] You couldn't create new records using HTTP verbs (e.g. JSON API)
# [MEDIUM] DataModel's automatic validation for INT columns with '0' default value was broken
# [LOW] Front-end rendering of XML forms results in a superfluous div when sidebar rendering is disabled.
# [LOW] InstallScript::_createAdminMenus didn't assign values for NOT NULL columns of the menu database table
# [LOW] AkeebaStrapper renderer would not access the session through the container
# [LOW] Json view would use getItemsArray() instead of get() thus not making use of eager loaded relations

Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* FOF has been rewritten in version 3 and breaks b/c. Good news: you can have FOF 2 and FOF 3 run side by side thanks to
  the new version using namespaces. Please consult the documentation wiki in the GitHub repository for information on
  how FOF 3 works.

Note for older versions
================================================================================
 FOF 2 follows a different development cycle. This CHANGELOG contains entries for FOF 3 only.
